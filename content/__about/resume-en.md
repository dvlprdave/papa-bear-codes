#PapaBearCodes

<div align="center">

Hey! I hope all is well. My name is David and I'm all sorts of things, but a father of two stands the highest (hence papabear). 

This blog is more of a notebook for myself and any who choose to learn or refresh what they might already know in this vast spectrum of web devlopment. My ultimate goal is to share what I've learned through small and digestable articles.

I genuinly hope you enjoy your stay and take a good wealth from it.âœŒ
